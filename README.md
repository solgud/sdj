This is a repository of exercises/homework/whatever done in my 2014 SDJ course.

If you're in my class and you're stumped on a question or want to see how I've approached something, you might find my code useful. I can't always guarantee that I'll have the correct answer or use the best approach, but I do write lots of comments and keep clean code.

Also, please feel free to file an issue if you have a comment or find an error.
